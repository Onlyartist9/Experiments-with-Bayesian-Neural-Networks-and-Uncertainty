We see that prominent transformer models in use (think LLMs and multimodal implementations more generally) struggle with [hallucinations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.05232#page=13.39) making them hard to use in mission-critical/operational environments. 

Overconfidence and a general inability to quantify uncertainty correctly seem to contribute to this. I thought it wise to examine the existing techniques that tackle uncertainty and learn and play with them in a variety of contexts.

This repo largely entails my experiments with ANNs and uncertainty as well as potential novel use cases that might arise that might arise from this play.
